  "intro_content": "James H. Miller Jr. Electric Power Plant is the most environmentally toxic–emitting power plant in the U.S. Combining both a visual language for information design and unique binding techniques, this book outlines the sheer toxicity of the power plant. This visual analysis is taken from census data found online. \n\nAs we went through this process, we noticed that in the year 2021 the emissions zeroed out, not because the got better but because they stopped tracking. Upon further research, 2021 was one of the worst carbon emitting years to date for them. ",
  "image_text_content": "To match the gritty industrial aesthetic, we used the risograph to print the front and back cover the book. The unique tight halftone dot pattern provided a feeling similar to those of small grates. "
