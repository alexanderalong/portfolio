Launched in 2006 with a focus on closing the opportunity gap for students from under-resourced communities, each individual Learning Lab empowers young people to create a future all their own.\n\nWith a flagship location in Anaheim and plans for more in the works, the team asked us to help them build a brand that could scale nationally and attract more students than ever before.",
